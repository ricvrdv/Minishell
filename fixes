fixed: 
cd was having jumps 
when executing invalid cmds i was missing a free_split but its now fixed (exec_utils)
heredoc are working 
can remove folder and cd still works
exit does not print exit when not needed

missing : 
signals (including broken pipes exemple cmd : < teste grep i > grep | <grep wc) leaks atm need to fi
some fds open when doing heredocs with redirections and multiple pipes
check_single quotes fails in some cases; after export and echo
